### About this project

## Background Gradient Color Changes

Build a sequential background color changing gradient website.

## The challenge

- Create a Github repository containing a suitable name for your task.
- Clone the empty repository to your local machine
- In the folder created on cloning the repository, create a one page website that changes its background gradient sequentially on clicking on the previous and next button. This means on clicking the next button, the background gradient should change to the next gradient in the default colors list; the reverse should happen on clicking the previous button.
- The initial background gradient on viewing the page for the first time must be (#780206 and #061161).
- A default list of background colors must be used. (Its referenced below)
- Once the default colors are exhausted, the background should again change to the first gradient on the list.
- Once the page is completed, push your changes to Github.
- Deploy it on Github pages.
